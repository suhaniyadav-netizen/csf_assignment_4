# Overview of the Project

This mini-project is a Python-based Simple Calculator that performs fundamental arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The calculator takes input from the user and outputs the result based on the selected operation.

The goal of this project is to practice programming basics and understand how to manage a project using VS Code, Git, and GitHub. It also helps build familiarity with functions, input validation, terminal-based interactions, and code organization.
